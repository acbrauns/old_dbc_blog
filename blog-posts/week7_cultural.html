		<h2>Cultural Blog: Personal Values</h2>

		
		<p>It&#39s hard to choose just one value that I would uphold as the single value that I put above all others. Creativity, close relationships, and introspection are the three most obvious values that I identify with. One thing that in some way encompasses all of those that I think truly is the most important value to me is genuineness.</p>

		<p>I to try to live up to my standards for being a genuine person most of the time. I&#39m a lot more a honest about certain things that many people. The last person to ask me for advice was asking about personal relationships in her life, which is a pretty common theme in our conversations.</p>

		<p>When I think about my values, I have mixed feelings about them. I think it is good to be genuine and introspective, have close relationships, and want to create things as a means of self-expression. At the same time, however, some of those things actually do all have the capacity to become extremely self-focused. Introspection can lead to wisdom, or can lead to a twisted self-concept in which I put myself on a pedestal. Creative works can be beautiful, but I can also up shirking the most important people in my life when I&#39m working on a project that I&#39m really excited about. Close relationships can be very fulfilling, but they can also lead to unrealistic expectations (i.e. &quotyou should make me happy&quot, particularly in the romantic context). All the things I value the most in life involve an immense depth of feeling, which can be wonderful or very selfish.</p>

		<p>This is why I desire to be a more compassionate person. I think I have the capacity to feel things deeply, so if I can do that on someone else&#39s behalf,  I would call that empathy. If I can render that when I see someone struggling, it helps me overcome my own perspectives and insecurities. I think that could help to eliminate stereotype threat&#45&#45albeit, any difficult interaction with other people.</p>

		<p>When I&#39m feeling down at DBC, I think it will help to realize that I&#39m not the only one struggling. It is going to be a challenge for everyone. Everyone is bringing their doubts and fears to the table. Having enough compassion to realize that I&#39m not alone will make it easier to have patience for both others and for myself.</p>
