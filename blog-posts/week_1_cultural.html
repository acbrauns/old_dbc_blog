		<h2>Dev Bootcamp Culture: Chefs in the Kitchen</h2>
			

		<p>Let me start off by saying this: so far, everyone from Dev Bootcamp who I have met, either via Google Hangouts or in person, has been incredibly friendly, fun, and good at communicating. It's only been a week and I already feel like I have new friends. That in itself gives me hope about what the culture of Dev Bootcamp is going to be like once we head to the city.</p>

		<p>However, I would be lying if I said I didn&#39t have some other reservations. First off, I do agree that we live in a consumer culture where people have a strong sense of entitlement and expectation. I agree that that is a mindset to attempt to overcome, not only at Dev Bootcamp but in any situation. I also agree that we have had "education trauma". We are given the cirriculum, told what we have to know, and we cross our fingers and hope that what we studied carefully will be on the test. That was college for me, and it was pretty ridiculous.</p>

		<p>That being said, I expected a little more guidance than there has been in the first week. I really do want to have the "kitchen mentality", but that is hard to do when we are not physically in the same location as other students and leaders (during Phase 0). Also, there have been many times within the last week where I felt that the expectations for the challenges weren't completely clear. Even when giving it my best effort and as much time as I had, I felt like there was not enough guidance, at least with getting started.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, I think the gaps that seems like a lack of guidance right now will ultimately be filled in later on. Either way I have hope that I will learn a lot and meet some wonderful people in the DBC community.</p>

		<!-- <p>Here's how I think I can put it best: I think I actully HAVE had the kitchen attitude for the last week when attempting to attack the challenges. But I've felt like I was in the kitchen mostly alone, sometimes with some other people who were also beginning cooks. And we had a shit ton of cookbooks and a week to make the recipes in them. Also, those cookbooks were $12,000.</p>

		<p>I know I sound negative, which is not my intention! I want to work hard, I want to be proactive, I want to learn to communicate well and learn as much as I possibly can. I want to accept risk and grow from all of the aforementioned challenges. I will do my best to do those things. I think that maybe the kitchen scenario that I just described will feel different once we are physically in the same location. I was just trying to be honest about how it feels at the moment. Hopefully if anyone else feels the same way they will feel comforted in knowing that they are not alone. I AM excited to move to the city and meet more awesome DBC people, but I confess that I am one of those people who feels like an imposter in the program. So, to borrow a motto from one of my favorite bloggers, here is my attempt at being positive about the scenario:</p>
